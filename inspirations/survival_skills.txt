In a post-apocalyptic world, how could you add value?

While my skills may sound mundane, I can say with certainty that when catastrophe strikes, you'll want me by your side. My mother was a Registered Nurse and I gravitated towards extreme sports. Skateboarding took me and proceeded to give me numerous injuries; from road rash to broken bones. Every time I got injured it turned into a learning experience where my mom would teach me how to dress the wounds and heal quickly. I once made a splint out of two q-tips and some tape.

I'd consider my second skill to be genetic, since I've stumbled upon the knowledge of having it. I have what farmers, and my grandmother, would consider to be a Green Thumb. I've never had my own garden but I've spent hours and hours in my aunt's berry farm, mother's vegetable garden, and my grandmothers flower garden. I'll till soil after a nice rain, germinate and plant seeds for proper sun exposure, develop natural fertilizer from my surroundings, and give the plants plenty of CO2(or human loving). When you see me throwing coffee grounds into the garden then urinating on them, you can be sure I'm facilitating growth.
