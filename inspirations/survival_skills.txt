While my skills may sound mundane, I can say with certainty that when catastrophe strikes, you'll want me by your side to heal your wounds and grow food. My mother was a Registered Nurse and I gravitated towards extreme sports. Skateboarding possessed me and proceeded to give me numerous injuries; from road rash to broken bones. Every time I got injured it turned into a learning experience where my mom would teach me how to dress wounds and promote quick healing. I'll be able to heal cuts, scrapes, rashes, and dislocated bones with minimal supplies to keep you in fighting shape and if you get bit by a zombie, well I'll do my best to reduce your pain. I once made a splint out of two q-tips and some tape.

I'd consider my second skill to be hereditary, since I've stumbled upon the knowledge of having a Green Thumb. Although I've never had my own garden, I've spent hours and hours at my aunt's berry farm, my mother's vegetable garden, and in my grandmother's flower garden. Each plant thrives with a specific fertilizer but the basic growing process is similar for most plants. Seeds love a soft, tilled soil after a nice rain and need to be germinated with a little bit of moisture before planting. Once we see the first signs of growth we need to keep them in direct sunlight, provide plenty of CO2(human loving), and keep away predators. To really facilitate growth I might gather some old coffee grounds, spread them around the garden, and then gently urinate on them. It's all about taking advantage of what you have.
