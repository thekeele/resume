First, and foremost, I'm passionate about maintaining my physical and mental health. Through regular exercise, healthy eating, and mental clarity I can continue operate at the high level I hold myself to. Technically, my passions revolve around the Internet, its infrastructure, and the policies that govern its operation. I've been fortunate enough to grow up during the information age and I'm not afraid to evolve myself along with new technologies.

Since building my first web application, I've been fascinated with how the Internet works and how data is transformed into beautiful, life-changing applications. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory I came in as an intern and revived a failing project through my hard-work, technical skills, and optimism. I was able to work with nearly every level of the modern web application stack and when I walked away from a successfully deployed project I knew this field was to be my career.

After my initial success I made it my goal to not only become proficient in the modern web application stack but to understand how networks are formed and how data is transmitted across them. My work at the Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies consisting of working with a stack of network tools that represented network topologies, monitored those networks, then deployed measurements on those networks. I learned how networks are built, how data is transmitted across interfaces, and how those networks form to make a network of networks.

From here, my goal is to take on new and innovative projects to further my experience in software engineering. After a significant amount of experience and time honing my skills I hope to earn the coveted title of full stack web applications developer. I want to have the skill set and confidence to solve problems and create products from scratch to deployment.
