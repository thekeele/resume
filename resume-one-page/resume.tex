\noindent\textbf{Software Engineer - Elixir}
\hfill{02/2020 -- 04/2021 (14 months)} \\
\href{https://scriptdrop.co/}{ScriptDrop} -- Columbus, Ohio

\begin{itemize}

  \item Helped design and prototype a text initiated prescription delivery app. Worked on customer facing form and a Plug to redirect users to where they left off. Shipped the product on a tight deadline then continued to iterate on it.

  \item Developed a new order fulfillment architecture on a remote two person team. Supplemented a GenStateMachine based system with an Oban based system. The new architecture was easier to reason about and fulfilled the requirements of the existing system. Deployed system with the launch of Uber as a delivery partner.

\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Software Engineer - Elixir}
\hfill{08/2016 -- 01/2019 (29 months)} \\
\href{https://www.onxmaps.com/}{onXmaps} -- Missoula / Bozeman, Montana

\begin{itemize}

  \item Learned Elixir and rewrote entire Ruby on Rails backend on a remote three person team. Developed data models based on existing MySQL database and a RESTful API for mobile and web clients. Migration to the new tech stack was successful and lead to funding for the company to continue growth.

  \item Lead backend design and development on a feature team for social login using OAuth 2.0 and client-side feature gating. Social login resulted in more account creations by reducing friction. Feature gating resulted in an ability to control feature rollout by user or app version. Leveraged Google Cloud PubSub to create a soft real-time system for our users with Play store subscriptions. Resulted in our system being in sync with the payment provider and a seamless subscription experience for users.

\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Research Assistant - Javascript}
\hfill{08/2013 -- 05/2015 (21 months)} \\
\href{https://pti.iu.edu/centers/crest.html}{Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies}, Indiana University -- Bloomington, Indiana

\begin{itemize}

  \item Worked on a small team of PhD candidates focused in the areas of network topology, instrumentation, and performance testing. Developed a full-stack asynchronous single page application built on top of WebSockets using Node.js and AngularJS. Integrated as a layer in an existing network instrumentation and measurement system.

  \item The application gave researchers the power to inspect nodes on a network, submit topological performance tests, and visualize the results in real-time. Gave demo of the software at the GENI conference on at-scale networking and distributed systems research and education.

\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Software Developer - Ruby on Rails}
\hfill{06/2012 -- 07/2013 (13 months)} \\
\href{https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/}{Leadership Computing Facility}, Oak Ridge National Laboratory -- Oak Ridge, Tennessee

\begin{itemize}

	\item Worked closely with a mentor, database engineer, and system administrator to replace a terminal based system. We built an internal application to track the resources and allocations for scientists and their projects on the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputer, Titan.

\end{itemize}
