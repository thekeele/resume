\subsection*{Work Experience}

\noindent\textbf{Software Engineer - Elixir / Phoenix Developer}
\hfill{08/2016 -- 01/2019} \\
onXmaps -- Missoula / Bozeman, Montana

\begin{itemize}

  \item Learned Elixir and rewrote entire Ruby on Rails backend on a remote three person team. Developed data models based on existing MySQL database and a RESTful API for mobile and web clients. Contributions were on par with the senior engineer on the team. Successful launch of the new tech stack in 9 months lead to a personal promotion and funding for the company to continue growth.

  \item Lead backend design and development on a feature team for social login using OAuth 2.0 and client-side feature gating. Social login resulted in more account creations and analytics of users. Feature gating resulted in an ability to control feature rollout and rollback for users on a specific version and/or app. Leveraged Google PubSub to create a soft real-time system for updating user payment, renewal status, cancellations, and app authorization. Resulted in our system being in sync with payment provider, seamless authorization for users, and greater introspection into user behavior.

\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Research Assistant - Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies}
\hfill{08/2013 -- 05/2015} \\
Indiana University -- Bloomington, Indiana

\begin{itemize}

  \item Worked on a small team of PhD candidates focused in the areas of network topology, instrumentation, and performance testing. Developed a full-stack asynchronous single page application built on top of WebSockets using Node.js and AngularJS. Integrated as a layer in an existing network instrumentation and measurement system.

  \item The application gave researchers the power to inspect nodes on a network, submit topological performance tests, and visualize the results in real-time. Gave talk and demo of the software at the GENI conference on at-scale networking and distributed systems research and education.

\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Ruby on Rails Developer - Leadership Computing Facility}
\hfill{06/2012 -- 07/2013} \\
Oak Ridge National Laboratory -- Oak Ridge, Tennessee

\begin{itemize}

	\item Worked closely with a mentor, database engineer, and system administrator to replace a terminal based system. Our goal was to build an internal application to track the resources and allocations for scientists and their projects on the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputer, Titan.

  \item Developed a traditional Ruby on Rails MVC application using Test-driven Development. Exposed to the full-stack from data modeling to full-text searching in UI. Deployed before end of term.

\end{itemize}
